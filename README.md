  -- Can be used with either QWERTY or DVORAK style typing 

  -- User can pick which letters they want to practice with by clicking on keys (twice to access special characters such as '&')
  
  -- User chosen letters will then be served to user randomly for 1 minute. +5 for correct answers and -3 for incorrect
  
  -- Pressing 'Learn' button activates psuedo machine learn option:
  
      1. After selecting 'Learn', press 'Practice' to start. During 1st round, app will learn users typing strengths and weaknesses
      
      2. On the following round, app will mutate the list to present keys that user had trouble with 50% more often
      
      3. Keys that the user is strong at will be seen less often
      
      4. Continuing rounds with the 'Learn' button activated will continue to mutate list to allow user to focus on weak keys
      
      5. Pressing reset will reset all the keys as well as the mutated learn list
  
  -- Pressing 'Fingerings' button will show suggested fingerings (aimed at Dvorak typers) 
  
  -- Use this typing app in combination with https://learn.dvorak.nl/ and https://www.ratatype.com/typing-test/
  
  -- This app was intended to compliment the above two websites letting the user pick which keys to work on
  
  -- This app also allows user to focus on numbers, special characters and the F1-F12 keys
  
  -- Dvorak typing app was created and coded by PJ Miller in C# in a succesful effort to master typing in Dvorak
